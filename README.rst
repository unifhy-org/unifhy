The Python package `unifhy` (Unified Framework for Hydrology) is a hydrological 
modelling framework which combines interchangeable modelling components for the 
surface layer, subsurface, and open water parts of the terrestrial water cycle. 
By two-way coupling these three components, the framework provides a fully
functional model for simulating the terrestrial water cycle. It is designed to
foster collaborations between land surface, hydrological, and groundwater
modelling communities by structuring their interactions around standardised
interfaces between the components.
